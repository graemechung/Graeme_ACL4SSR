# Gemini Context: ACL4SSR Configuration

This repository contains a personalized `.ini` configuration file for use with `subconverter`. 

The primary goal is to manage and version-control this single configuration file, which in turn references rule sets from the official ACL4SSR repository.

**Key Resources:**
- **Subconverter Documentation:** https://github.com/tindy2013/subconverter
- **ACL4SSR Repository:** https://github.com/ACL4SSR/ACL4SSR

**Workflow Notes:**
- To reference a specific ACL4SSR ruleset, find its "Raw" URL on GitHub and provide it to me.
- To apply changes based on `subconverter`'s documentation, provide the documentation URL.
- Do not clone the entire ACL4SSR repository.
- Keep the focus on managing the `.ini` file.
- Changes are pushed to the `graemechung/Graeme_ACL4SSR` GitHub repository.
